# Initial Response

Sure! Here is an example Python script that reads data from a CSV file called 'input.csv', processes it (in this case, multiplying each number by 2), and outputs the results to a new CSV file called 'output.csv':

```python
import csv

# Read data from input.csv
with open('input.csv', mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    data = [row for row in reader]

# Process the data (multiply each number by 2)
processed_data = [[str(float(cell) * 2) for cell in row] for row in data]

# Write the processed data to output.csv
with open('output.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for row in processed_data:
        writer.writerow(row)

print("Data has been processed and saved to output.csv")
```

Make sure to create an 'input.csv' file with your desired data before executing the script. This script will read the data from 'input.csv', process it (in this case, multiplying each number by 2), and then save the results to 'output.csv' file.
